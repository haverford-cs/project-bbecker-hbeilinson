# project-bbecker-hbeilinson

Hannah, 12/4/19, 2ish hours:
- Cloned the repo locally and added the dataset into the folder.
- Put the dataset into the gitignore since it's so large.
- Set up main.py and imported SKlearn RandomForests.
- Chose to partition dataset into 80% training data and 20% testing data. Wrote a function to make this partition.


Brian, 12/4/19, Also 2ish hours:
- Cloned the repo
- Pushed the proposal pdf
- Wrote util.py, with function read_csv, which converts data to a label vector and examples matrix
